### Hi 👋

I’m a techie 👨‍💻 creating simpler solutions to complex problems.

I’m passionate about Open Source and have contributed to many open source projects over the years. I’m the author of [gRPCxx — An ultra fast gRPC server implementation in C++](https://github.com/uatuko/grpcxx), [Sentium — Global scale fine-grained access control system that’s simple and flexible](https://github.com/uatuko/sentium) and [nisos — A real-time operating system with a corporative kernel](https://github.com/uatuko/nisos), to name a few of my open source projects.

Professionally, I’m a CTO with over 10 years’ of experience in leading and scaling cross-functional teams in multiple startups to create innovative products.

I blog about my experiences [here](https://u-a.medium.com) and regularly post content on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uatuko/).
